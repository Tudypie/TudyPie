As a passionate programmer, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to advance my skills and knowledge. My focus lies primarily in game development, with a specialization in utilizing the Unity Game Engine. With over four years of experience in Unity, my expertise centers around C# programming, as well as modeling 3D assets and creating sound effects and music. Through my efforts, I have released 16 successful projects that have accumulated over 60,000 views and 20,000 downloads, and I am currently working on a commercial game project planned for release on the Steam platform.

To continually enhance my skill set, I am actively engaging in courses to deepen my understanding of Web Development, including HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL. Additionally, I am interested in incorporating Artificial Intelligence into my applications and broadening my knowledge in this area by using programming languages like Python. By expanding my skill set, I hope to create innovative and engaging experiences that will captivate and delight users.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I remain dedicated to my education as a high school student, with a focus on preparing to further develop my skills and knowledge at the college level.
